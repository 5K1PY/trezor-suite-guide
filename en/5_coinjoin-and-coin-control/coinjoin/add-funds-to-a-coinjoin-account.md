# Add funds to a coinjoin account

Once you've added your coinjoin account to Trezor Suite, the next step is to send yourself some bitcoin (from your regular account) so that it can be anonymized.

### Send bitcoin to your coinjoin account

* On the coinjoin account overview page click the **'Receive BTC'** button.
* On the **'Receive'** page you'll see the beginning of a fresh address that you can use to receive your bitcoin.&#x20;
* Click on **'Show full address'**  and then **confirm the address using your Trezor.**
* Once confirmed, click on **'Copy address'** and then close the receiving address modal window.
* Navigate to your regular bitcoin account (the account holding the coins you wish to anonymize) and select **'Send'.**
* Paste the receiving address into the **'Address'** field.&#x20;
* Enter the desired amount of bitcoin you wish to send to your coinjoin account into the **'Amount'** field; alternatively you can use the **'Send max'** toggle switch to send all funds from your regular bitcoin account to your coinjoin account.

The recommended minimum amount is **1,000,000 sats.**&#x20;

* Set a **Fee.**
* Once you've finalized the transaction details, click on **'Review & Send'** and confirm the transaction details using your Trezor device.
* Finally, click on **'Send'** in Trezor Suite.

Once the transaction is confirmed and the funds have landed in your coinjoin account, you are ready to **reclaim your privacy.**
