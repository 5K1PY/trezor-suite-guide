# Add funds to a coinjoin account

{% hint style="info" %}
Trezor's third party coinjoin coordinator zkSNACKs will discontinue their service as of 1st June 2024. Coinjoin users do not need to move their private funds elsewhere, and all accounts will remain accessible after this date.

Once you've added your coinjoin account to Trezor Suite, the next step is to send yourself some bitcoin (from your regular account) so that it can be anonymized.

### Send bitcoin to your coinjoin account

* On the coinjoin account overview page click the **'Receive BTC'** button.
* On the **'Receive'** page you'll see the beginning of a fresh address that you can use to receive your bitcoin.
* Click on **'Show full address'** and then **confirm the address using your Trezor.**
* Once confirmed, click on **'Copy address'** and then close the receiving address modal window.
* Navigate to your regular bitcoin account (the account holding the coins you wish to anonymize) and select **'Send'.**
* Paste the receiving address into the **'Address'** field.
* Enter the desired amount of bitcoin you wish to send to your coinjoin account into the **'Amount'** field; alternatively you can use the **'Send max'** toggle switch to send all funds from your regular bitcoin account to your coinjoin account.

The recommended minimum amount is **1,000,000 sats.**

* Set a **Fee.**
* Once you've finalized the transaction details, click on **'Review & Send'** and confirm the transaction details using your Trezor device.
* Finally, click on **'Send'** in Trezor Suite.

Once the transaction is confirmed and the funds have landed in your coinjoin account, you are ready to **reclaim your privacy.**
