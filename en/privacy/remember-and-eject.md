# Remember and Eject

Remember and eject is a feature that gives you control over ease of use, privacy, and security.

Remember is a feature that allows you to turn your wallets into a watch only address. If you leave your device locked away in a safe place, the only way to know that your coins are still in your control is to take it out, plug it in, and unlock it. This allows you to monitor your coins without needing the device or your private keys.

Eject will remove the wallet from Trezor Suite. If you are using a shared or more public computer, you may want to not have your wallet balances viewable by anyone who has access to the computer in use. This will also benefit those who have multiple devices and wants to keep one Trezor viewable in Suite but the second device private.
