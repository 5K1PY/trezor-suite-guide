# Ethereum (ETH) staking

**Staking** is the process used for validating transactions on blockchains that use the so-called "Proof of Stake" consensus mechanism. Ethereum's switch from Proof of Work (PoW) to PoS through its upgrade to Ethereum 2.0 was motivated by several key factors, each aimed at improving the network's efficiency, security, and scalability.

By staking ETH, you can earn interest as a form of passive income, while also supporting the Cardano network and contributing to its stability.

#### **Staking ETH in Trezor Suite:**

* In Trezor Suite, to go the **Accounts** page and select your Ethereum wallet.  If youâ€™ve got 0.1+ ETH, youâ€™re ready to start staking.
* In the menu bar you will see the **Staking** tab.
* Click on **Start staking**.
* Enter the amount of ETH you wish to stake.
* Check the box to acknowledge the **entry period** conditions, and then select **Confirm & stake.**
* Confirm the amount and recipient address using your Trezor: press **Confirm** on your device once youâ€™re happy the details match.
* Once youâ€™ve confirmed the **address, fee** and **total amount,** select **Stake.**

Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ve started staking your ETH. You will need to wait for the transaction to be confirmed, and then for the funds to be added to the stake pool, which can take a few days. Any time you need to check the status of your staked ETH, just open the Staking tab in Trezor Suite.
