# Cardano (ADA) staking

**Staking** is the process used for validating transactions on blockchains that use the so-called "Proof of Stake" protocols, such as Cardano.

Unlike bitcoin and other "Proof of Work"-based cryptocurrencies, Cardano users participate in the network governance by delegating their funds.

By staking ADA, you can earn rewards as a form of passive income for holding Cardano. You will also be supporting the Cardano network and contributing to its stability.
