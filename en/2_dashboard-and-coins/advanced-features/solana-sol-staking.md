# Solana (SOL) staking

Staking Solana (SOL) is a way to grow your SOL balance while helping to secure the Solana network. Unlike Bitcoin, which uses mining, Solana relies on a combination of Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of History (PoH) to process transactions quickly and efficiently.

#### How does staking SOL work?

Staking SOL is made effortless with Trezor Suiteâ€™s seamless integration with [Everstake](https://everstake.one/), Trezorâ€™s trusted staking partner. When staking SOL via Suite, your SOL is delegated to an existing validator, meaning you can stake without requiring technical expertise or specialist hardware.

Delegation lets you earn staking rewards while supporting the network, all while keeping full control of your funds. Validators benefit tooâ€”they receive a higher stake, which increases their chances of being selected to confirm transactions and earn rewards, which are then shared with delegators.&#x20;

> ğŸ’¡ To stake SOL in Trezor Suite, you need a minimum of **0.01 SOL** in your wallet.

#### **Staking SOL in Trezor Suite:**

* In the side-bar menu, select your Solana wallet.  If youâ€™ve got **0.01+ SOL**, youâ€™re ready to start staking.
* In the menu bar select **Staking**, then click on the **Start staking** button.
* Read the information shown in the **Staking in a nutshell** window, then select **Continue.**
* Carefully read the information shown in the **Stake SOL** window; check the box to acknowledge you consent to staking with [Everstake](https://everstake.one/) and select **Confirm.**
* Set the amount of SOL you wish to stake, then select **Continue.**
* Confirm the **entry period**, then select **Confirm & stake.**
* Confirm the necessary actions on your Trezor device, then click the **Stake** button.

Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ve started staking your SOL. Staking on Solana requires a warm-up period of one epoch, which is approximately 2-3 days. During this time, your SOL will be delegated to the validator, and after the epoch ends, youâ€™ll start earning rewards.

Your staked SOL will begin earning rewards within three days, and rewards will automatically compound to maximize your returns. You can track your staking progress directly in Trezor Suite.

#### Unstaking SOL in Trezor Suite:

* Open Trezor Suite and go to the Solana Staking tab. Here, youâ€™ll see an overview of your staked SOL.
* Click **Unstake** to begin the process.
* Choose the amount of SOL youâ€™d like to unstake.
* Select **Unstake** and confirm the transaction on your Trezor device.
* Wait for the unstaking period to complete (approximately one 2-3 day epoch).
* Once the unstaking process is finished, go back to the Staking tab and click **Claim** to withdraw your SOL to your Trezor wallet.
