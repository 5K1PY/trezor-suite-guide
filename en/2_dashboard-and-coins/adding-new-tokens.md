# Adding new tokens

The Ethereum network allows projects and companies to create a variety of custom tokens which run on top of Ethereum. Once the token contract has been deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, it is automatically compatible with your Trezor device. Trezor Suite currently allows you to manage ERC20 tokens.

Other tokens (e.g. ERC721 and ERC1155) can be managed through third-part apps such as Metamask.

#### **Accessing Ethereum accounts in Trezor Suite**

* Go to **Accounts**
* Click on the plus (âž•) symbol in the **My accounts** sidebar menu
* Select **Ethereum** from the list of cryptocurrencies, then **Find my Ethereum accounts**
* Your Ethereum account will then be listed in the **My accounts** sidebar menu

#### **Adding ERC20 Tokens in Trezor Suite**

ERC20 are the most common types of tokens on Ethereum. As soon as a smart contract has been created for the token, you can use your Trezor device with that token. Trezor hardware wallets support these tokens by letting you import the custom token address in Trezor Suite to monitor it. These will automatically appear in Trezor Suite if it is supported or you can learn how to add a custom token.

* Select your **Ethereum** account
* Go to **Receive**
* Click **Show full address**
* Check the address **exactly matches** the one shown on your Trezor device
* Copy the receiving address and use it as a destination address for sending your ERC20 tokens
* Once you have sent some tokens to the address, they can be viewed under the **Tokens** bookmark

If your tokens are not listed there you can add them manually:

* Click on the three dots and **'Add token'**&#x20;
* Then enter the contract address; the contract addresses of all tokens can be found here: [https://etherscan.io/tokens](https://etherscan.io/tokens)
* Once your first token has been added, you can continue to add mroe through the drop-down menu
