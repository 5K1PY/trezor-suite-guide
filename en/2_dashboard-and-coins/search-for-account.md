# Search for account

With labeling enabled, you can rename accounts in Trezor Suite to something more memorable.

If you need to search for a specific account, just type the name in the 'Search' input field at the top of the **'My accounts'** side menu in Suite:

The simple example above shows the result of searching for "New" for a user who has a Litecoin account named "New Litecoin account".

Search results are automatically filtered and displayed directly in the side menu.
