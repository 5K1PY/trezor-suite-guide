# View-only & Eject

Trezor public keys can be stored on the host machine to track balances stored on the wallet. The **View-only** and **Eject** functions give you control over ease of use, privacy, and security for each wallet enabled on your Trezor.

Access View-only and Eject in Trezor Suite by clicking on the top-left button showing your Trezor.

**View-only** lets you monitor your balances and transactions in Suite after your Trezor is disconnected. It tracks the wallet extended public key (XPUB), which gives information about address holdings.

**Eject** removes the wallet from view while Trezor Suite is running. Ejecting a passphrase-protected hidden wallet requires the user to enter the passphrase again. Ejecting a standard wallet will stop tracking address balances. To find the wallet again, click **Add wallet**, or reconnect and unlock your Trezor.

If you are using a shared or public computer, wallet balances could be viewed by others who have access to the computer. Always eject any wallets to prevent revealing this information.
