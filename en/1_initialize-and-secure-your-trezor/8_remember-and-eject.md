# Remember & Eject

Trezor public keys can be stored on the host machine to track balances stored on the wallet. The **Remember** and **Eject** functions give you control over ease of use, privacy, and security for each wallet enabled on your Trezor.

Access the Remember and Eject settings by clicking on the top-left button showing your Trezor.

**Remember** allows you to monitor your coin balances without needing your Trezor or your private keys. It tracks the wallet extended public key (XPUB), which gives information about address holdings.

**Eject** removes the wallet from view while Trezor Suite is running. Ejecting a passphrase-protected hidden wallet requires the user to enter the passphrase again. Ejecting a standard wallet will stop tracking address balances. To find the wallet again, click **Add wallet**, or reconnect and unlock your Trezor.

If you are using a shared or public computer, wallet balances could be viewed by others who have access to the computer. Eject any saved wallets to prevent revealing this information.
