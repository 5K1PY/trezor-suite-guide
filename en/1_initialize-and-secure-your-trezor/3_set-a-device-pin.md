# Set a device PIN

Your PIN is a critical security feature and should be enabled before sending any coins to the device.

**Your PIN should be memorable,** as it cannot be recovered if forgotten. However, as long as you have a copy of your recovery seed (and passphrase is used) access to your funds can still be restored.

#### **Setting a PIN**

During the onboarding process, you will be prompted to set a PIN.

**Your PIN should be at least 4 digits long.** All Trezor hardware wallets support a PIN up to 50 digits.

If you skipped this step during onboarding, you can set your PIN from the Trezor Suite Dashboard or through the **Device settings** menu.

#### **Changing a PIN**

You can change a PIN at any time via ⚙️ **Settings > Device**. The process of setting a PIN is different for each Trezor model:
