# Supported coins

Trezor hardware wallets support thousands of coins and tokens, both natively in Trezor Suite and through third party tools. A full list of coins and compatible wallets is available on our [Supported Coins & Tokens](https://trezor.io/coins) page.

Cryptocurrencies that are not natively supported in Suite can be managed using a third-party wallet interface such as [Electrum](https://trezor.io/learn/a/electrum-and-trezor) or [MetaMask](https://trezor.io/learn/a/metamask-and-trezor).

Using a third-party wallet with your Trezor provides the same level of protection for your keys as Trezor Suite.

#### Adding a cryptocurrency asset in Trezor Suite

On the Trezor Suite Dashboard, click the **Enable more coins** button in the **Assets** overview section (just below the Portfolio graph). You will then be taken directly to the **Coins** settings menu:

* Enable a cryptocurrency by clicking on it and then selecting **Activate coins**.
* A green check mark indicates that particular cryptocurrency is now enabled in Suite.

The **Coins** settings tab can also be accessed via the main side-bar menu:

* In the side-bar menu, click on **Settings**, then select the **Coins** tab.
* Add the coin you wish to trade by clicking it, then the **Activate coins** button.

To disable a coin, go to the **Coins** settings menu and click the coin you wish to remove from Suite.
