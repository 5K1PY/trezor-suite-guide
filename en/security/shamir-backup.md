# Shamir Backup

While this feature is not found in device settings, Trezor Model T users can use Shamir backup to protect their seed from loss or damage.&#x20;

Shamir backup creates multiple shares instead of a single seed. Users can set a threshold of shares required to recover their wallet. The extra shares are a backup in case some of the others are lost, stolen or damaged.&#x20;

### Creating a Shamir Backup

‚ö†Ô∏è To create a Shamir backup on a used device, the Trezor memory must be wiped. Make sure you have a recovery seed safely backed up for any wallet already loaded on the device.

1. With a new or wiped Trezor Model T, follow the Onboarding to create a Shamir share backup, or visit Device Settings and choose Create backup.
2. Set a total number of shares.
3. Set a threshold for recovery.
4. Write down all words of each share in order, use a separate piece of paper for each share.&#x20;
5. Once complete, secure each share in a safe location isolated from the others.
6. To recover your funds, you will need to collect as many shares as the threshold you set.&#x20;
