# Shamir Backup

While this feature is not found in device settings, Trezor Model T users can use Shamir backup to protect their seed from loss or damage. Shamir backup creates multiple shares instead of a single seed. Users can set a threshold of shares required to recover their wallet, making any extra shares a backup in case some of the others are lost, stolen or damaged.
