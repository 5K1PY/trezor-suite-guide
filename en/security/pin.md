# PIN

Trezor hardware wallets use a personal identification number \(PIN\) to prevent other people from using your device.

Your PIN is a critical security feature and should be enabled before sending any coins to the device.

Your PIN should be memorable. It cannot be recovered by Trezor Suite or Trezor wallets if lost or forgotten.

### Setting a PIN

During the [onboarding](https://www.notion.so/Onboarding-2f138f9b72074f69b354941d96cb32c0) process, you will be prompted to set a PIN. Setting a PIN is essential to security.

It will need to be entered to unlock your Trezor any time you connect it to a host computer or perform a protected action.

Ideally PINs should be at least 6 characters long. Trezor hardware wallets support longer PINs up to 50 characters.

If you skip this step during onboarding, you can later set your PIN from the Trezor Suite Dashboard, or through the Device Settings menu.

The process of setting a PIN differs depending on the hardware wallet you are using.

### Changing a PIN

You can change a PIN at any time through the Device Settings menu.
