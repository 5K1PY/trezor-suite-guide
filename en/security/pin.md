# PIN

Trezor hardware wallets use a personal identification number (PIN) to prevent other people from using your device.

Your PIN is a critical security feature and should be enabled before sending any coins to the device.

Your PIN should be memorable. It cannot be recovered by Trezor Suite or Trezor wallets if lost or forgotten.

### Setting a PIN

During the onboarding process, you will be prompted to set a PIN. Setting a PIN is essential to security as it is used to unlock your Trezor any time you connect it to a host computer or perform a protected action.

:bulb: PINs should be at least 6 digits long. The Trezor Model One supports up to 9 digits and the Trezor Model T supports up to 50 digits.

If you skipped this step during onboarding, you can set your PIN from the Trezor Suite Dashboard or through the Device Settings menu.

### Changing a PIN

You can change a PIN at any time through the Device Settings menu. The process of setting a PIN differs depending on the hardware wallet you are using.
