# Ethereum Tokens

The Ethereum network allows projects and companies to create a variety of custom tokens which run on top of Ethereum. Once the token contract has been deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, it is automatically compatible with your Trezor device. Trezor Suite only allows you to manage ERC20 tokens for the time being.

Other tokens can be managed through third-part apps such as Metamask. Below, we will cover three types of tokens: ERC20, 721, and 1155. These are all token standards with slightly different purposes.

**ERC20 Tokens**

These are the most common types of tokens on Ethereum. As soon as a smart contract has been created for the token, you can use your Trezor device with that token. Trezor hardware wallets support these tokens by letting you import the custom token address in Trezor Suite to monitor it. These will automatically appear in Trezor Suite if it is supported or you can learn how to [add a custom token](https://www.notion.so/Adding-custom-tokens-1926b51f567e4fc5a0f0eea91876cbdb).

**ERC721 tokens**

These are non-fungible tokens, commonly referred to as NFTs. You can store NFTs on an Ethereum address that is controlled by your Trezor device but it will not be shown in Trezor Suite. If you send an NFT to an Ethereum address but don't see it in Suite, it is not lost, it simply doesn't appear in Suite - you can still view and use it within other wallets that have ERC721 support.

**ERC1155 tokens**

This is a token standard that allows you to create fungible and non-fungible tokens at once. Depending upon the use case, these may or may not be viewable in Trezor Suite. If not, then you can use a third party wallet to view them.
