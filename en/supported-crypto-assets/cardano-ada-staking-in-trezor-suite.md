# Cardano (ADA) - Staking in Trezor Suite

**What is Staking?**

Staking is the process used for validating transactions on blockchains that use the ‚ÄúProof of Stake‚Äù (PoS) consensus mechanism, with Cardano being one of the best-known examples.&#x20;

Unlike Bitcoin and other "Proof of Work"-based cryptocurrencies, Cardano users participate in network governance by delegating their funds.

Users can either run their own stake pool and participate directly, or delegate their ADA to an existing staking pool, combining the weight of many users‚Äô delegated funds to compete for rewards from creating blocks.

üí° You must pay a deposit of 2 ADA to register your delegation, and then a small network fee to broadcast the transaction to the network and have it included in a block.

**Why do it?**

By staking ADA, you can earn rewards as a form of passive income for any Cardano transactions your pool validated during one epoch, which is a 5-day cycle. Staking helps keep validation decentralized, supporting the Cardano network and contributing to its stability.

**Is it safe?**

Yes, your funds are safe, as long as you keep your private keys (recovery seed) stored securely offline using your Trezor hardware wallet.

**What if I want to stop delegating?**

You can send your funds elsewhere at any time, as long as you unstake them. You can even send all of your funds to an exchange and sell them. If you do nothing, your funds will be automatically restaked to the same pool at the end of each epoch. You will need to de-register the stake key in order to retrieve your 2 ADA deposit.

**Can I delegate to several pools simultaneously?**

You can only delegate the full balance of your wallet to one pool at a time. If you wish to delegate to multiple pools at once, you must send a portion of your balance to a different wallet. You can either create a new Cardano account via ‚ÄòMy accounts‚Äô, or you can use a wallet associated with a different passphrase or recovery seed.
