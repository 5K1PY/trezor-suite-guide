# Cardano (ADA) - Staking in Trezor Suite

**What is Staking?**

Staking is the process used for validating transactions on blockchains that use the so-called "Proof of Stake" protocols, such as Cardano. Unlike with Bitcoin and other "Proof of Work"-based cryptocurrencies, Cardano users participate in the network governance by delegating their funds.

The user can either run their own stake pool and participate directly, or delegate their ADA to a staking pool, combining the weight of many users to compete for rewards from creating blocks.

**Why do it?**

By staking ADA, you can earn rewards as a form of passive income for holding Cardano. You will also be supporting the Cardano network and contributing to its stability.

**Is it safe?**

Yes, your funds are safe, as long as you keep your private keys (recovery seed) stored securely offline using your Trezor hardware wallet.

**What if I want to stop delegating?**

You can send your funds elsewhere at any time. You can even send all of your funds to an exchange and sell them. Your funds will stay delegated to a pool until the current epoch ends, then the registration expires automatically.

**Can I delegate to several pools simultaneously?**

No, you can only delegate the full balance of your wallet to one pool at a time. If you wish to delegate to multiple pools at once, you must send a portion of your balance to a different wallet e.g. a hidden wallet using a different [passphrase](https://wiki.trezor.io/Passphrase).

**Staking ADA in Trezor Suite**

* In Trezor Suite, to go the **Accounts** page and select your Cardano wallet
* In the menu bar you will see the **â€˜Stakingâ€™** tab
* Press the **â€˜Delegateâ€™** button
* Using the device touchscreen, confirm the on-screen instructions to register your stake key
* Review the details of the proposed delegation and use your device to confirm the transaction

ðŸ’¡ You pay two small fees for your delegation. First there is a fee of about 2 ADA to register your delegation, and then a small fee to broadcast the transaction to the network and have it included in a block.
