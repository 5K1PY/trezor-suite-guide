# Supported Coins

Assets are cryptocurrencies and tokens secured by your device. On the Trezor Suite Dashboard, the Assets overview under the portfolio graph displays a list of coins and balances for any cryptocurrency currently enabled within Suite and stored on your Trezor hardware wallet.

If a cryptocurrency is missing from the list it may be disabled. Enable it from the coins menu by clicking on Enable more coins.

### Adding a cryptocurrency asset

From the dashboard, simply click on Enable more coins. You will be taken to the coin list, where each individual asset can be turned on or off. You can also enable all coins at once, which will find all balances of those coins stored on the device.

#### ERC20 tokens

Ethereum network ERC20 tokens can be managed using Trezor Suite by adding custom token addresses to a new or existing Ethereum [Account](https://www.notion.so/Accounts-60adc181cc424c90877650768cb8053d).

### What assets can I store on my Trezor?

Trezor Suite natively supports thirteen cryptocurrencies and all ERC20 tokens. Other cryptocurrencies are supported by Trezor hardware wallets but must be managed using a third-party wallet interface such as Electrum, Metamask, Monero wallet or AdaLite wallet. These cryptocurrencies are referred to here as non-native assets.

Using a third-party wallet with your Trezor provides the same level of protection for your keys as when using Trezor Suite.

#### Supported coins

Trezor hardware wallets support hundreds of coins and tokens, both natively in Suite and through third party tools. For a full list of coins and which wallet to use with them, visit [https://trezor.io/coins/](https://trezor.io/coins/).

#### Natively supported coins

Many coins are available directly through Trezor Suite. Simply visit the coin tab through the settings menu or via the Enable more coins button on the Dashboard, under your portfolio graph. There, you can toggle all coins or pick specific ones to use with your device.

Using [bitcoin-only firmware](https://shop.trezor.io/btc-only/), you will only have access to Bitcoin. This is recommended for anyone who does not intend to secure other cryptocurrencies with their Trezor hardware wallet.

#### Non-natively supported coins \(using third-party wallets\)

Some cryptocurrencies use specific technology stacks that make it difficult to support them directly in Trezor Suite. Many third-party wallets support Trezor as a way to sign transactions and provide security, while being built and maintained by a company other than SatoshiLabs.

This includes currencies such as Monero and Cardano, as well as ERC721 tokens, known as NFTs, which are all secured by wallets created by third parties.

#### Ethereum Tokens

All Ethereum ERC20 tokens are supported by Trezor Suite. To add them, simply create an Ethereum [account](https://www.notion.so/Accounts-60adc181cc424c90877650768cb8053d) and click Add token to add a new token using its contract address.

To find a token's contract address, simply search for the token in your preferred search engine and copy the contract address from its project homepage or using an Ethereum block explorer like Etherscan. Once enabled, you will be able to view balances of the token under the Ethereum Account menu.
