# Receiving crypto

To receive cryptocurrency safely using your Trezor hardware wallet, all you need to do is generate an address and provide it to the sender.

This is a common part of using cryptocurrencies, but there are security and privacy aspects that must be considered. Trezor Suite helps you to manage receiving addresses safely.

#### How to receive crypto in Trezor Suite:

1. Make sure that you have **enabled** the cryptocurrency you wish to receive in Trezor Suite. Cryptocurrencies can be enabled any time via ⚙️ **Settings > Crypto.**
2. Open the **Accounts** page; in the left column choose the cryptocurrency and the account that you want to receive funds with. Make sure you **create the correct type of address** for the cryptocurrency you're trading.
3. Click on **Receive** and then **Show full address.**
4. Confirm that the addresses match by cross-checking the address shown in Trezor Suite with the address shown on your Trezor device.
5. Click **Confirm** on your Trezor device.
6. Click **Copy address** to copy the address to your clipboard, or use the QR code to receive funds in the account you have selected.

#### **Trust only your Trezor**

Only trust details shown on the screen of your Trezor hardware wallet. If they do not match those shown on your computer, there may be malware on the host machine. Cancel the transaction and restart the process from a secure device if you notice any inconsistencies.
