# Sending crypto

Sending a transaction is a straightforward process, but please make sure all transaction details are correct on your Trezor before confirming anything.

1. The transaction recipient will provide you with an address. **Copy this into the Address field.**
2. **Enter an amount to send.** This can be denominated in fiat or crypto. Always check it is correct before proceeding.
3. **Set a network fee.** Preset amounts are calculated based on current network throughput. A custom amount can also be set. Trezor Suite will warn you if the fee is abnormally high, but you can check average fees for recent transactions online to set a reasonable price.
4. Click **Review & Send.** Ensure all details shown on-screen are correct and the exact same address and amount are shown on your Trezor device.
5. Confirm the transaction on your Trezor and then click **Send** in Trezor Suite.

#### **Fees**

Network transaction fees vary depending on how busy the network is. Trezor Suite estimates fees based on the priority of the transaction. These are Low, Economy, Normal, and High.

ðŸ’¡ Fees are only used to pay miners for adding transactions to the blockchain. They are not paid to Trezor or SatoshiLabs.
