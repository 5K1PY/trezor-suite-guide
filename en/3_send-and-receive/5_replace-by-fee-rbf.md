# Replace by Fee (RBF)

Replace by fee, or **RBF**, lets you set a condition that allows a transaction be replaced by another which is identical in all aspects but has a **higher miner fee** assigned to it. This can be done multiple times while the transaction is unconfirmed.

RBF means you can **accelerate a transaction** and have it added to the next block. The feature can also be used to **finalize a transaction.**

### **Using RBF in Trezor Suite**

RBF is enabled by default in Trezor Suite, meaning all transactions may have the associated fee 'bumped' at a later stage.&#x20;

#### Bump a transaction fee

Increase the fee allocated to any unconfirmed RBF transaction by clicking **Bump fee** on the pending transaction in the **Overview** tab.

A dialog will open that lets you assign a new fee, which must be higher than the previous one. Click **Replace transaction** and then confirm the action on your Trezor.
