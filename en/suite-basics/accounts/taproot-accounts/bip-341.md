# BIP 341

BIP 341 includes the definition of pay-to-taproot (P2TR). This represents a brand-new method of sending Bitcoin, combining the functionality of P2PK and P2SH scripts, with the outputs using Schnorr signatures as opposed to ECDSA. Using a new script type, P2TR enables users to send funds to a Schnorr public key (or the Merkle root of some other scripts). This new script can be used to generate Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXO) that can be spent by the private key owner, or anyone else who can fulfill the requirements of any script within the Merkle tree.
