# BIP 340

BIP 340 introduces **Schnorr Signatures**, which offers privacy and security advantages over ECDSA (i.e., elliptic curve digital security algorithm). As with ECDSA, Schnorr signatures use elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), but offers numerous advantages over ECDSA regarding efficiency, storage and privacy.

The most notable improvement realized through Schnorr signatures is _key aggregation_, which eliminates the requirement for multiple public keys and signatures. Usually, if multiple parties want to sign the same message (e.g. spending from a multisig address) then each party must include their public key plus signature. This is not ideal in terms of computation and storage requirements. Key aggregation on the other hand does _not_ require multiple public keys and signatures. Using Schnorr signatures, each party can trustlessly combine their public keys to generate a single public key. Each party can then sign the same message using their individual private keys. Subsequently, the signatures can be combined to generate a single signature, valid for the new 'combined' public key. This means that verification is required for only _one_ signature and _one_ public key. Effectively, this creates smaller transaction sizes through data aggregation.
