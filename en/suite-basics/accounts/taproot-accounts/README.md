# Taproot accounts

Taproot represents the first major upgrade to Bitcoin since SegWit was implemented in 2017. It comprises three Bitcoin Improvement Protocols (BIPs), and will improve Bitcoin's functionality. Taproot improves both privacy and network efficiency, making Bitcoin transactions safer. More complex transactions will be quicker to send, thanks to the fact that with Taproot, the wallet no longer needs to send the often extensive history of transactions which preceded the one being spent.

The update comprises three different BIPs - namely [**BIP 340**](bip-340.md), [**BIP 341**](bip-341.md) and [**BIP 342**](bip-342.md)****
