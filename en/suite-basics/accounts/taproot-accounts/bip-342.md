# BIP 342

BIP 342 is an update to the Bitcoin scripting language, enabling Bitcoin nodes to create and validate P2TR outputs. BIP 342 consists of both new and updated codes. These scripts -- collectively known as 'Tapscript' -- are used to verify Taproot transactions and Schnorr signatures.

The Taproot upgrade also introduces MAST (Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree), which renders complex transactions such as multisig and Lightning Network transactions indistinguishable from basic transactions. This increases the difficulty of analyzing and tracing Bitcoin transactions.

Ultimately, Taproot is a significant upgrade that means developers have an greater tool set to use for creating more extensive Bitcoin applications, whilst simultaneously benefiting anyone transacting in Bitcoin by increasing network efficiency and providing a greater level of privacy.
