# Import

To send multiple Bitcoin transactions at the same time, use Trezor Suite's Import transaction feature.

1. Create a table of transactions.
2. Export a `.csv` file containing `Address, Amount, Currency (BTC or USD)`.
3. Go to Send.
4. Choose Import from the ellipses dropdown menu.
5. Drag and drop the `.csv` file or browse using your file explorer. Multiple transactions will be populated at once. 
6. Assign a fee to the whole batch of transactions.
7. Click Review & Send.
8. Verify each transaction address and amount on your device.
9. Click Send.

ðŸ’¡ By importing transactions in batches, additional transaction data takes less space and less additional fees. Sending dozens of transactions using Import makes bitcoin invoicing and payments a quick and cheap process.
