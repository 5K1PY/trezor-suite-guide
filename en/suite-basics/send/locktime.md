# Locktime

**Locktime** is an optional part of Bitcoin [transactions](https://wiki.trezor.io/Transaction). It sets the earliest time a transaction can be mined into a block. It is possible to use locktime with [Trezor](https://wiki.trezor.io/Trezor) to make sure that a transaction is locked until a specific block height or a point in time.
