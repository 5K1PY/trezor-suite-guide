# Set up device PIN\*

Your PIN is a critical security feature and should be enabled before sending any coins to the device.

**Your PIN should be memorable.** It cannot be recovered if forgotten.

#### **Setting a PIN**

During the onboarding process, you will be prompted to set a PIN.

💡 Your PIN should be at least 6 digits long. Both the Trezor Model One and Trezor Model T support a PIN up to 50 digits.

If you skipped this step during onboarding, you can set your PIN from the Trezor Suite Dashboard or through the **Device settings** menu.

#### **Changing a PIN**

You can change a PIN at any time via ⚙️ **Settings > Device**. The process of setting a PIN differs between the Trezor Model One and Model T:

#### **Trezor Model One**
