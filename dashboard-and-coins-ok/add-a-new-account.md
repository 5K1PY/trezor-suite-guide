# Add a new account\*

An account will be created for each cryptocurrency enabled during device setup.

Multiple accounts can be created for each cryptocurrency. You can create additional accounts to separate your funds, or manage them on one account using multiple addresses.

* To **create a new account**, click on the plus (+) icon at the top of the **My accounts** sidebar
* This will open the **New account** menu, where you can choose the type of account to create using the drop-down menu
* The new account can be the same type as an existing account as long as the preceding account has been used (i.e., you cannot create multiple empty accounts of the same type).
