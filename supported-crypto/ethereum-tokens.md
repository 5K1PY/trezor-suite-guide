# Ethereum tokens

The Ethereum network allows projects and companies to create a variety of custom tokens which run on top of Ethereum. Once the token contract has been deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, it is automatically compatible with your Trezor device.

Trezor Suite currently offers native support for ERC20 tokens. Send ERC20 tokens to any Ethereum address you own and they can be found in Trezor Suite.

Other tokens (e.g. ERC721 and ERC1155) can be managed through third-party apps such as Metamask.

#### **Accessing Ethereum accounts in Trezor Suite**

* Go to **Accounts.**
* Click on the plus (âž•) symbol in the **My accounts** sidebar menu.
* Select **Ethereum** from the list of cryptocurrencies, then **Find my Ethereum accounts.**
* Your Ethereum account will then be listed in the **My accounts** sidebar menu.

#### Using ERC20 tokens with Trezor

* Choose **Ethereum** from the **My accounts** menu.
* Go to the **Receive** tab.
* Click **Show full address.**
* Check the address **exactly matches** the one shown on your Trezor device.
* Copy the receiving address and use it as a destination address for sending your ERC20 tokens.
* Once you have sent some tokens to the address, they can be viewed under the **Tokens** bookmark.

If your tokens are not listed there you can add them manually: click on the ellipsis (...) drop-down menu and then **Add token.** Next, enter the contract address. The contract addresses of all tokens can be found here: [https://etherscan.io/tokens](https://etherscan.io/tokens)
{% endhint %}

#### Custom tokens

Create a new Ethereum address through an Ethereum Account and then send the token to that address.

Once a token is received at that address, you can keep track of it by adding its **Contract Address** to Suite:

1. Go to your **Ethereum account** and switch to the **Tokens tab.**
2. Click on the **Add token** button (or select Add token from the drop-down menu).
3. You will be asked for the token contract address, which will find the token and add it to your assets.
4. Tokens usually list their contract address on the official project website but they can also be found using Ethereum block explorers such as [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).
5. Once your first token has been added, you can continue to add more through the drop-down menu.
