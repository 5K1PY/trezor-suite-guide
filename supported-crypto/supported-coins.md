# Supported Coins

Trezor hardware wallets support hundreds of coins and tokens, both natively in Suite and through third party tools. A full list of coins and compatible wallets is available on the [Supported coins](https://trezor.io/coins) page on the Trezor knowledge base.

Trezor Suite natively supports fourteen cryptocurrencies and all ERC20 tokens. Other cryptocurrencies are supported by Trezor hardware wallets but must be managed using a third-party wallet interface such as Electrum, Metamask, or Monero wallet.

Using a third-party wallet with your Trezor provides the same level of protection for your keys as Trezor Suite.
