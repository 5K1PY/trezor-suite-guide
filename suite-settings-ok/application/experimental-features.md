Here you can choose to join (or leave) the Early Access Program (desktop app only), which is an opt-in feature that allows users to test new features coming to Trezor Suite one week ahead of the official public release.

#### **Joining the Early Access Program**

* Click on the **Settings** gear icon (⚙️) in Trezor Suite.
* On the **Application** settings page, scroll down to the **Experimental Features** section.
* Click on **‘Join’.**
* In the **Early Access Program** window, check the **‘I understand’** box to agree to the terms, and then click **‘Join the Program’.**
* You will then see confirmation that it has been enabled, and you can either check for beta updates immediately, or the next time you launch Suite.
* Once enabled, an icon shaped like a star will appear in the top-right hand corner of Trezor Suite:

#### **Leaving the Early Access Program**

* Click on the icon to go straight to **Experimental Features.**
* Click **‘Leave’.**
