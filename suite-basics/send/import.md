# Import

To send multiple bitcoin transactions at the same time, you can use the **Import** transaction feature in Trezor Suite:

1. Create a table of transactions.
2. Export a `.csv` file containing `Address, Amount, Currency (BTC or USD)`.
3. Go to **Send.**
4. Choose **Import** from the ellipses drop-down menu.
5. Drag and drop the `.csv` file, or browse using your file explorer. Multiple transactions will be populated at once.
6. **Assign a fee** to the whole batch of transactions.
7. Click **Review & Send**.
8. **Verify** each transaction address and amount on your device.
9. Click **Send.**

By importing transactions in batches, additional transaction data requires less space and lower additional fees. Sending dozens of transactions using **Import** makes bitcoin invoicing and payment a quick and cheap process.
